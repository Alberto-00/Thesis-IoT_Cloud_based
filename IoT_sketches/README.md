## ❗❗❗ESP32 board ❗❗❗
In the `secure_TLS_sketches` folder, a modified version of the `WiFiSecureClient` library was used to use TLS. To use it, in the Arduino IDE you download the **esp32 board** `version 2.0.17`, later versions will not work. 

Also, import the libraries into the `Librerie` folder in the Arduino IDE.
